# AUT LaTeX Templates

A collection of LaTeX templates for Auckland University of Technology (AUT) students and researchers. This repository provides two distinct templates for different academic needs:

- [**Article Template**](article-template): For writing academic papers, reports, and articles
- [**Beamer Template**](beamer-template): For creating academic presentations

## Template Overview

### üìÑ Article Template

This template is based on the LaTeX `article` document class, suitable for course reports, research papers, and other documents that don't require complex formatting like theses.

**Key Features:**
- Pre-configured with AUT-themed fonts and margins (reference paper: [Verifying Images and Media](https://ajeuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Verifying-Images-and-Media-A5.pdf))
- Includes basic structure for title, author, date, and abstract

### üéØ Beamer Presentation Template

This template is designed for creating academic presentations. **The visual theme (`.sty` style file and related resources) for this Beamer template is built upon the open-source project [sarahemarshall/aut-theme](https://github.com/sarahemarshall/aut-theme). I extend our thanks to the original author [sarahemarshall](https://github.com/sarahemarshall) for their work.
